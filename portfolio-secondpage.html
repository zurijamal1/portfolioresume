<p>
Hi, my name is Zuri! I usually draw a blank when I talk about myself, as if I don't already know what I am into, but I'll start with the basics.
I am currently a student at Henry Ford College (Go Hawks!).  I am a theater/film major, and is planning to branch my studies to American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Los Angeles, California. 
In the future, I want to work in film, whether starring in them or making my own (or both, who knows!) 
I really enjoy playing my guitar and keyboard, and my hobbies include writing poetry, knitting, reading and listening to music. I am currently working on learning another language, like Greek or Japanese.

I have done some previous code in the past, but being able to learn new knowlegde and apply that with old information will
 always fascinate me. I love being able to apply what I learn to projects and exploring all endless possibilities, especially why things do the things they do and why,
 and I think coding is an example of how to do this.

<h5>Career Trajectory</h5>

    A lot of people ask this question to me. Since AMDA is an audtion application school, they tend to ask this question as well, to get a good feel as to where you see your life heading. 
Back then, I didn't have  good answer. But now that I've had time to think and process my dreams, I am proud to say that I have a definitive answer. 
In 2 years, I see myself graduating from Henry Ford College, getting my associates degree in theater. I want to be able to get all the training that I can get while I'm at Henry Ford with my 
acting coach/professor George Popovich. In 5 years, I see myself working towards solidifying my dreams even more by attending AMDA in Los Angeles and working towards being financially stable and comfortable in what I do.
I also see myself publishing a few poetry books, since I'm passionate about it as well. I'm going to achieve my goals by putting in the effort and making sure that I am working hard to acheieve where I want to go, because I refuse 
to give up on my dream for anything, and I wouldn't accept any other path except the path I have set for myself.
